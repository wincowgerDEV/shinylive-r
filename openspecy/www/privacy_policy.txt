Log Data
We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,” even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, or visit a third-party service that includes Open Specy content, we may receive information. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links and buttons on our services, including when you install another application through Open Specy. We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the functionality of the tools on the site, the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.

Non-Personal Information
We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people visited the site, the number of people who clicked on a particular link, some inferred interests, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.
